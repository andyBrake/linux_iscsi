Installation
------------

This iSCSI target implementation requires a recent 2.4 kernel. The
kernel itself requires a small patch:

	cd <kernel-src>/linux-2.4
	patch -p0 < <iscsi-target-src>/kernel.2.4.??.diff

The archive includes various version of the kernel patch for several
kernel versions. After applying the patch recompile the kernel and
install it.

The iSCSI target consists of a kernel module and a daemon. The
compilation of the kernel module requires the path to above kernel
sources:

	make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src>

The path can also be set by editing the main Makefile. This will build
the module and the daemon. To install both use:

	make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src> install

The kernel module will be install in the module directory of the kernel
and after the next reboot, it can be loaded with "modprobe
iscsi_trgt_mod", the daemon will be installed as iscsi_trgtd under
/usr/sbin.

Configuration
-------------

The daemon is configured via the configuration file /etc/iscsid.config.
See the example file for the current syntax.
The example iscsid.rc can be used to automatically start and stop the
iSCSI targets.

Misc
----
During the development the following iSCSI initiator drivers were used
and so are known to work with this implementation: the Linux driver by
Cisco available from http://linux-iscsi.sourceforge.net/ and the Windows
driver by Microsoft available from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/
